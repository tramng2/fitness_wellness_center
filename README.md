## Reflection

  - This is the final project of school coursework.
  - This project display and storage customer's data, as a admin you are able to add/edit/remove a customer. Moreover, this application show schedule of training as calendar format or table format, similarly, as a admin you are able to add/edit/remove an item.
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - This project applied basic and core concept of React and other technologies.
  - I used create react app for initializing the project, choosing using React as it is what I was learning in this course. Instead of using table in Material Ui, I choose AgGrid because it has already easy buit-in functionalities.
